Agenda for today

MVC Framework EF6 - pull in database ***Might try NOT DATATBASE FIRST ENTITY (which we have used)

BUT CODE FIRST ENTITY****

REPEAT using EFcore - pullt database


Razor pages which is C# in the brower

ASP Framework : Points to note from Yesterday

lets look at project in detail

App_Data folder: where our database can live : Either .mdb proper database(Microsoft Database File)
although the default location is in your USer Profile ie C:\User\HematShah\SQL\Northwind.mdb

| Datadirectory\Northiwind.mdb

or of course we cpould use SQLite and give similar path


Content
     Public content eg script sent publicly to client

      Rest of code is hidden (C# is hidden at server , turned into HTML)

 
Font
  File obtained from web 
        .eot -> extended open type
        .ttf -> True Type Font
        .woff -> web open form format

        ==> DownLoad a FONT FILE AND LINK TO INT IN CSS


        Web.Config (and app.Config)
               
               When we build and run our application we 'compile' the code.

               This code is generated as MACHINE BYTE-CODE which operates at LOW LEVEL and talks to the 
               Processor directly

                  Config files are used in applications to provide A MECHANISM FOR CHANGING SETTING 
                  WITHOUT RE-COMLIEMIG .  AT RUNTIME WE CANC ALTER VARIOUS SETTINGS


                     THINGS WE MIGHT WANT TO ALTER

                        1) database path between development and production
                        2) Security strings (API keys) 


# MVC

   AS stated 
    M -> Model (data)
    V -> View  (Page)
    C -> Controller (URL handling)

            Domain.com/Controller/Action.../Id
                      /Table... / GET      / ALFKI



                      /        /         Index VIEW
                      /Home    /About    About VIEW
                      /home    /Contact  Contact VIEW


          
    Request  page
       check  https://domain.com/Home/About   part and in code, go to HomeController.cs file
                
                In HomeController.cs file look for the About() method   ((Action))

                In this method , can get dtata if needed



var products = db.Products.Include(p => p.Category).Include(p => p.Supplier);
            return View(products.ToList());  <========== INNER JOIN USING .INCLUDE AS SUPPOSE WRITING A QUERY


#mvc core

   we are goign to build a database website using .NET Core 
   
     Caution ==> use .NET Core 2.1 (Stable) and libraries 2.1.1


     additional projects itemds to consider 


         wwwroot folder contains all publicly available files
           css  eg. bootstap.css
           JS
           Images


           Startup.cs

              This is equivalent of our Main() method ie Start website

              Services

                 Background items   eg a) Database b) 3rd Party authentication

                                eg   Google authentication


#Controllers and putting data on a page

   with razor syntax we can use C# in the browser


   @......html

   <p>Some data recieved from the back end is @ViewBag.MyItem and also
       @ViewData["AnotherItem"]</p>

   ''''''cs

     public IActionResult MyAction() 
        {
            ViewBag.MyItem = "This is some data";
            ViewData["AnotherItem"] = "\nThis is also some data";
            return View();
        }

   ''''''  


   Making a list

cs code ...


....


In Razor page we access data Importing model

//Using statement ie importing this model
@model Lab_27_mvc_core_controllers.homecontroller

// @Model - fetch data
@foreach(var item in MODEL.mylist2)
{
	<li>item</li>
}
