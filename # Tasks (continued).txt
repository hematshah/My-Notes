# Tasks (continued)

We had earlier discussed about

   CPU  
   ... runs THREADS
   ... AND ON PROCESS CAN HAVE MULTIPLE THREADS
   .. AND WE CAN SEE EACH PROCESS AS A .EXE IN TASK MANAGER

   Threadf .. set of instructions to CPU 
   process ... .exe running live in mememory


    Two Types Of Process

        - Backgrpund Service Computer Startup (no user present)
        - application User log on and run the app (after login)


        Services : view with 'get-service' or 'Services' snap-in

        .exe(..) ... multiple threads ... alk to CPU


  Within our Application
  
    we have our main thread which always starts

        synchronous : WAIT ALWAYS
        Asynchronous : Create SubTasks to do our work - Application IS FAST

        Older versions 
           Threading : DETAILED AND DIFFICULT TO GET RICHT (OVERHEAD)

        currently 
            
            TASKS : Abstractionm OVER TASK IE microsoft does a lot of work for you
