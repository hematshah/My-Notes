Agile : imbraces Change
Watetfall : Linear, fixed model : good for smaller projects, repeatable projects
ewg in manufacturing, construction
V-model : extension to waterfall : mission critical where perhaps life is at stake so extra
testing is vital : heavy industry 

events 
delegates: 
Delegate instance += method
Declare 

CRUD
Event: EXTERNAL INTERACTION (External to the program)
           USER EVENTS EG BUTTON CLICK/DOUBLECLICK/MOUSECLICK/ MOUSeENTER/ MOUSELEAVE

                HTTP : // GET DATA

                   REQUEST => CLIENT => SERVER
                   RESPONSE   SERVER => CLIENT

                   FETCH (URL)
                       THEN (CALLBACKFUNCTION)
                       THEN 


REF  use to this to pass primitive type use this to pass primitive type into a method and retreat it like a global variable

          a global variable 

             int  x=10;
                DoThis(ref int x){... alter x as a GLOBAL VARIABLE}
 PRIMITIVE : in me
