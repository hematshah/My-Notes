# Introduction to Web

lets start by dowloading two copies (C:/ in powershell then run)

1) git clone https://github.com/philanderson888/showcase  find index.html

2) git clone https://.............................../boostrap


notes: vectors are scalelable  SVG => scalable vector graphics
       canvase are NOT scalable only use for gaming character but when you scale it 

--> p5.js --> animations <-- go to website
--> material UI <-- by google

Modern web today

install NODEJS.org

 > node -v       PROGRAM  TO RUN ON WINDOWS, LINUX OR MAC

 > npm -v     NODE PACKAGE MANAGER MANAGER INSTALL LIBRARIES JUST LIKE NUGET IN VS/C#

                        ...INTO THE     NODE_MODULES... FOLDERS

 EXAMPLE

     HELLO WORlD NODE APPLICATION   

     Javascript was INVENTED as a PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE TO RUN NETSCAPE
     NAVIGATOR EARYLY WEB BROWSER

     When the web took off, also javascript was catapulted into the front line even though it was not a sophisticated language. in fact it had some glaring bugs which exist today!

     netscape => Mozilla => Firefox => chrome dominating web

     But!  Someone had a bright idea to bring JAvascript out of the browser
     and to run it as a standalone application. why?


     Website 

     Client: Browser+Javascript                    Server   PHP?
                                                            ASP?
                                                            Java?
                                                            Phyton?

                                                            Javascript!!!! Node!!

     to run node we just type
     
     > node myFile.js

       shortcut for commandprompt ' H and the "tab" ' 


RAW HTML, CSS, JAVASCRIPT

How to use Libraries (eg Bootstrap) in 2 ways

1) Download the file locally
   Advantage: All files under your control
   Disadvantage : Extra pressure on your web server to deliver files
                  which it doesn't have to

2) get the files from CDN link (CDN -> Content Delivery Network) 

      Global place for holding common files

           Spaced out across world so yuo use the nearest server to you


    Advange : you  don't host these files
    Disadvantage : none really except careful if OFFLINE USAGE is an issue

    Care ! Check that we have the right file by adding a CHECKSUM TO THE LINK

      IN computing we can test the Intergrity or VALIDITY of the file with

      something we call a HASH or a CHECKSUM

      ## Simple Web Tips

      css

          .class  Multiple occurences  <div class = "x">      .x{....}

          #id      One occurence   <div id "y">               #y{....} 


          flexbox-used for having semitrical alignment

          grid -->

     NOTE   ==> blazor -> new way of having c# code compiler run inside the browser itself
                running on the client side


            ==> Razor  ->   {conversion from C# into HTML,CSS,JS}
