SQL  - Connecting C# to a database with raw SQL

Last week we did the 'Hello world' version of connecting c# to SQL database using NOT entity AND not LINQ but Raw SQL INSTEAD

lets finish this app by building a CRUD app which able, edits delets and lists Customers.



## .NET Core

add 3 rabbits manually to get started in sql

c# 

use entity core(trainer will lead this bit) to connect
to rabbit DB

Agile : Sprint 0;
create 100 rabbits, one every interval and display them on the screen as they generate.

.net core : connect to database

add nuget libraries

microsoft.entity.frameworkCore     -v 2.1.1
                 .sql Server       -v 2.1.1
                 .design           -v 2.1.1


## RabbitDB : Part2

let's extend our work with OOP and creating objects

sprint 0 
   create 100 rabbits
    id 1,2,3,4
    name = "Rabbit" + id RAbbit1 Rabbit2  ((upgrade Rabbit01, rabbit02))
     Age = 0;

 sprint 1
    create one rabbit
    create loop
       every iteration of loop means age  increase by 1 month
       Read every rabbit 
       every rabbit can create 'spawn' one new rabbit (age 0)
       increase age  of existing rabbits Age++;

  loops go like this
  
     Loop              Population    Age
     before begin        1            0
     0                   1=>2         1,0
     1                   2=>4         2,1,0,0
     2                   4=>8         3,2,1,1,0,0,0,0


          repeat loop until population reaches ceiling (say 1000)

 Sprint 2 (Advanced challenge)

    Easy upgrade : set an age below which a rabbit connot produce another rabbit

    eg choose age of 3 then we have to also test for codition

    0
    1
    2                     3
    3                     4 0
